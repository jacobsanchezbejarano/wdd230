It is the most populous non–state-level government entity in the United States. Its population is greater than that of 40 individual U.S. states. At 4,083 square miles (10,570 km2) and with 88 incorporated cities and many unincorporated areas, it is home to more than one-quarter of California residents and is one of the most ethnically diverse counties in the United States. Its county seat, Los Angeles, is also California's most populous city and the second-most populous city in the United States, with about 3.9 million residents. More recently, statewide droughts in California have further strained both the city’s and Los Angeles County’s water security.
