            <p>
                Founded on February 26, 1561, by the Spanish captain Ñuflo de Chaves, the city underwent several location changes.

At the beginning of the 20th century, in the south, the war for the territory of Chaco broke out.

            <h3>Santa Cruz has been registering a higher growth rate in the country</h3>
            <p>
                
                Since 2011, the GDP of Santa Cruz has been registering a higher growth rate the country, which made it possible to reduce the precipitous drop in the national GDP in 2020 so that it would not be greater than 8.8% (Santa Cruz decreased this year by only 4.3 %), says a report from the Bolivian Institute of Foreign Trade of Bolivia (IBCE).

                The projected population of the Department of Santa Cruz by 2022 is 3.4 million people, of which 56% is in the Municipality of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, with about 1.9 million inhabitants (in 1950 it had just 42,000 inhabitants).
            </p>
            <p>    
                Santa Cruz de la Sierra displaced La Paz to second place in its contribution to the national economy, and Cochabamba is in third place. The eastern region is responsible for providing the highest percentage of food to the national market but also exports a variety of agricultural products to neighboring markets.

                Information from the IBCE shows that in 2010 the GDP of Santa Cruz was around 5,000 million dollars and in 2019 it exceeded 10,000 million, and there are still no figures for 2021, but it is expected to exceed the figure of two years ago.
